Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.
B
In pre-order, it firt visit the root and go left, then right and from start to 2, it
is going tobe smaller. so 2 is the left root node value, and its parent is 7, and 8 is
the right subtree of 7. So, in post-order, it visit left subtree, then right suntree,
then parent, so it start with 2, 8, 7... 

(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c) Give the rotations that are performed (if any) as a result of
    inserting each value.
Do left rotation of node 22,
