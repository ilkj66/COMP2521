NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: For the worst case, the Bfs functions will visit every every cells in maze,
but it will check the cell is visited or not which means the functions will only visit every cells
once, and in the back tracking part, the number of visiting cell will less than n, so 
the worst time complexity is O(n).

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: In worst case, Dfs function will go through every cells once, which use O(n).
The backtracking path conclude number of cells less than n.
