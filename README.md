# COMP2521 Data Structure and Algorithms
Term: 2025T1 \
Record my own code in this course includes lab, assignment and final exam practice. \
Suggestions for students who's going to take this course:
- Lab is important, and the final exam's questions won't be harder than lab, so you will be fine if you are comfortable with lab questions.
- Strongly recommend implement the data structures(eg. Queue,Trees..) and algorithms(eg. bfs, dijkstra's..) by yourself after lecture.
- Most of labs need manually marked, so you have to explain your work to tutors. Remember to add comments on your code.
- Doing Leetcode and the given practice exam will help a lot if your are aiming a DN or higher mark.
- Understanding how the data structure and algos work makes you fine with the theory part in final.
