Merge Sort: Best Case: O(nlogn), Worst Case: O(nlogn);
Quick Sort: Best Case: O(nlogn), Worst Case: O(n^2);

If there are numbers of key value pairs data, and they are sort by keys and
if we dont want to change the previous value order of values, we should use merge sort, because merge sort is stable
and quick sort is not.
