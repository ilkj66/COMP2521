Question 1

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.

O(nlogn)

Every time of breaking down use O(n) and it needs (log2)^n times to break down all questions,
so total time of braking down is O(nlogn), and it takes the same time of combining, so the total time is 
2 * nlogn which is O(nlogn).
