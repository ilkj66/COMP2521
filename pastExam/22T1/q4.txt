Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Kruskal's Algorithm
Only Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm can used to find mst.
The first edge and the second in the mst are not connected, so it can not be Prim's algorithm.
