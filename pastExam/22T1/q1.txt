Question 1

(a) What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
    answer.

10 + log1000 base 2 = 10 + 9 = 19

(b) Which of the two algorithms is more efficient? Justify your answer.

Binary search is more efficiency, because after every split the array, binary search only need to check once, and 
Quad search need to check three times. When we using binary search after 3 times the array are only 1/8 size of before,
and Quad search only make the range 1/4 of before. 

(c) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.

func A : O(b - a);
func B : O((b - a)^2);
