Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the method you would use to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.

Testing and recording the time with random input data, keep double the size of data, and check the time use,
if there as the size doubled if the time become 4 times of previous time, it is selection sort, because its average time
complexity is O(n^2), the other is quick sort, because the average time complexity id O(nlogn)

(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.

The sorting algorithm is stable, quite confident and sure. The sorting result didn't change the previous order of the second number 
of each pairs.
