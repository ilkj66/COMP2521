Question 9

Which data structure and algorithm would you use to solve the task?
Justify your answer.

Use Graph data structure, and Prim's / Kruskal Algorithm.

The islands are vertex in graph and bridges are edges. Prim's / Kruskal Algorithm will find the shortest path that can
go through every single island.
